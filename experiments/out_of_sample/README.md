# Out-of-sample evaluation

In this dir, we evaluate the model with conditions that are NOT in QUASR.

- `evaluate_model.py` evaluates the model and saves the evaluation data.
- `make_boxplot.py` will make box plots showing the model performance.
- `generate_modB_data.py` will generate data for making modB contours as well as vtk files
    of surfaces.
- `make_modB_plot.py` will plot the modB contours alongside images of the surfaces.
